### Project Scope and Objectives

#### Project Name
PokéDealFinder: AI-Powered Pokémon Card Trading Assistant

#### Project Overview
PokéDealFinder is a web-based application designed to assist users in buying and selling Pokémon cards as a side business. The initial phase will focus on developing an AI-powered chatbot that helps users find undervalued cards and great deals to maximize their profit potential.

#### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python with Flask framework
- Frontend: Web-based interface (potentially using Vue.js)
- Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- AI/NLP: To be determined (considering options like DialogFlow or custom implementation)

#### Development Strategy
We will take a phased approach to development:
1. Phase 1: Develop a basic AI chatbot with core functionality
2. Phase 2: Integrate comprehensive card database and price comparison
3. Phase 3: Implement deal alert system and advanced features

#### Project Goals
1. **Develop an AI Chatbot**: Create an intelligent chatbot that can interact with users to provide insights on Pokémon card values and identify potential deals.
2. **Integrate Card Database**: Establish a comprehensive database of Pokémon cards, including pricing data from major marketplaces.
3. **Implement Price Comparison**: Enable the chatbot to compare prices across different platforms and highlight undervalued cards.
4. **Alert System**: Develop a notification system to alert users of new deals and price drops.

#### Project Objectives
1. **AI Chatbot Development**
   - **Specific**: Develop a chatbot using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) API to interact with users and provide card value insights.
   - **Measurable**: The chatbot should be able to handle at least 80% of user queries accurately within the first month of launch.
   - **Achievable**: Utilize existing NLP frameworks such as DialogFlow or Wit.ai.
   - **Realistic**: Start with basic functionalities and expand based on user feedback.
   - **Timely**: Complete the chatbot development within 3 months.

2. **Card Database Integration**
   - **Specific**: Create a database that includes all Pokémon cards, with real-time pricing data from major marketplaces like eBay and TCGplayer.
   - **Measurable**: The database should cover at least 90% of the Pokémon card market.
   - **Achievable**: Use web scraping tools and APIs to gather data.
   - **Realistic**: Focus on major marketplaces initially, expanding to others as needed.
   - **Timely**: Complete the database integration within 2 months.

3. **Price Comparison Functionality**
   - **Specific**: Implement a feature that allows the chatbot to compare card prices across different platforms.
   - **Measurable**: Ensure the price comparison feature can process queries in under 5 seconds.
   - **Achievable**: Leverage existing APIs and scraping tools for price data.
   - **Realistic**: Start with a few major platforms and expand over time.
   - **Timely**: Implement this feature within 1 month after the database is set up.

4. **Deal Alert System**
   - **Specific**: Develop a notification system to alert users of new deals and price drops on Pokémon cards.
   - **Measurable**: The system should be able to send alerts within 10 minutes of detecting a deal.
   - **Achievable**: Use push notification services and integrate them with the chatbot.
   - **Realistic**: Focus on high-value cards and significant price drops initially.
   - **Timely**: Implement the alert system within 1 month after the price comparison feature is live.

#### Deliverables
