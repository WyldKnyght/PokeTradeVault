   - **Realistic**: Focus on major marketplaces initially, expanding to others as needed.
   - **Timely**: Complete the database integration within 2 months.

3. **Price Comparison Functionality**
   - **Specific**: Implement a feature that allows the Rasa chatbot to compare card prices across different platforms.
   - **Measurable**: Ensure the price comparison feature can process queries in under 5 seconds.
   - **Achievable**: Leverage existing APIs and scraping tools for price data.
   - **Realistic**: Start with a few major platforms and expand over time.
   - **Timely**: Implement this feature within 1 month after the database is set up.

4. **Deal Alert System**
   - **Specific**: Develop a notification system to alert users of new deals and price drops on Pokémon cards.
   - **Measurable**: The system should be able to send alerts within 10 minutes of detecting a deal.
   - **Achievable**: Integrate push notification services with the Rasa chatbot.
   - **Realistic**: Focus on high-value cards and significant price drops initially.
   - **Timely**: Implement the alert system within 1 month after the price comparison feature is live.

#### Deliverables
1. **FastAPI with spaCy AI Chatbot**: A functional AI-powered chatbot capable of handling user queries about Pokémon card values and deals.
2. **Card Database**: A comprehensive database of Pokémon cards with real-time pricing data.
3. **Price Comparison Tool**: A feature integrated with the chatbot that allows users to compare card prices across different platforms.
4. **Deal Alert System**: A notification system that alerts users of new deals and price drops.

#### Timeline
- **Month 1**: Project setup, Rasa installation and initial configuration, database design, and initial data integration.
- **Month 2**: Complete database integration and start Rasa chatbot development.
- **Month 3**: Finish Rasa chatbot development and implement price comparison functionality.
- **Month 4**: Develop and integrate the deal alert system with Rasa, conduct testing, and prepare for launch.

#### Development Steps
1. Set up the development environment (Python, Flask, Rasa, SQLite/PostgreSQL)
2. Initialize Rasa project and define intents, entities, and dialogue flows for Pokémon card trading
3. Integrate Pokémon TCG API and implement web scraping for additional data
4. Develop custom actions in Rasa for querying the card database and comparing prices
5. Implement the price comparison algorithm within Rasa's custom actions
6. Create a web-based chat interface (potentially using Vue.js) that interacts with the Rasa chatbot
7. Develop and integrate the deal alert system with Rasa
8. Conduct thorough testing of the Rasa chatbot's responses and overall system accuracy
9. Gather user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality
